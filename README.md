## Weather app with React

My first weather application made with react. Made as part of a team effort. I wanted to improve the previous JS version with some extra features. This project is made with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>react</strong>.

### How to open the project:
- in VScode open the terminal
- Make sure you have the latest node installed, or at least 15.6 version (or higher) <em>node --v</em>
- open "weather-app" folder if you somewhere else <em>cd weather-app</em>
- install the dependencies <em>npm install</em>
- launch the project <code>npm start<code>
